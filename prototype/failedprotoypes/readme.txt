P5 was initially chosen because of familiarity and ease of learning to build the first prototype

After trying to intialize a basic .obj feature, I began encountering problem (which now, in retrospect, 
were probably related to the local server/ file recall not happening properly). 

The documentation online related to 3D and P5 was not very robust, and it was worrisome at this early point in the project

The choice to move to three.js is made because of the much more robust content, examples, and online support as well as 
capacities within 3D
