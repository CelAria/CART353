Artist Statement:
Diffractive Methodologies


This web-based 3D logo object functions as an iconification of my personal brand, a web-specific introduction 
to my professional website. At the core of this specific piece is the intention to exemplify the philosophies 
of my work: the intersection of technology and art as their own unique perspective that can be differentiated 
from mere interdisciplinary practise. The concept of “diffraction” is in addition visually explored through the 
project’s use of digital “diamonds” and the light they “refract”. 

Themes from my past personal branding such as crystals and my geometric emblem are explored in ways that optimize 
the capacities of web (which allows movement), and novelty of experience.

This work strengthens my personal identity as an artist by breathing life into the icons and emblems I have
created to represent my artistic self, and exploring methodological approaches to process. This work is 
representative of my philosophy of creating and my methods which are always the same- approaching my work with 
the complement of creative artistry and a scientific thinking.
